# neighborhood-noms
In reflecting on the goals of this project I have done self assessment regarding my comprehension of the last 15 weeks of coursework at Ada. In this project I would like to:

  * Have a clearer understanding of working with APIs (with a stretch goal of the VCR testing I lacked from my Tunes + Takeout project)
  * Refactoring and writing simple, clean methods
  * Write better tests, and truly work toward TDD
  * Work on styling (the last project that had me coding styling was TaskListRails - I have not gotten enough practice at this. Though this really should be a stretch goal, as I do not know that I can complete the above points and this within 15 hours.)

Baseline questions:
What is the goal of the project?
  This rails app will utilize the Yelp API to create a Neighborhood Noms Passport. Watching my neighborhood, Greenwood, clean up after the March gas explosion made me consider how small locally owned businesses must stretch each dollar, because their profit margin is so small. The goal of this app will be to gamify supporting locally owned restaurants, by providing users a digital "passport" to each (or a set number) restaurant in their neighborhood, community, or street. After a user dines at one of their passport locations, they can mark that location as visited. Upon completing their passport, users will receive a badge, and an opportunity to generate a new passport.   

Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
  Really, Jake and I. But I suppose also any youngish, kidless couple who perpetually asks "So, what do you want to do about dinner?"

What are your personal learning goals?
  See above.

What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
  Obvs Ruby, Rails, an ActiveRecord database, HTML, CSS, and the Yelp API.

What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
See above.

What does success look like for this project? What does done mean?
Success should always be measured in understanding, which is what I am looking for deepening with this project. I intend to keep a time log/code journal to be committed with the rest of the project.
