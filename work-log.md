**5/24-5/26:**

  * **Elements Worked On:** Brainstorming.
  * **Thoughts:** See Read Me.
  * **Current Amount of Time Elapsed:** I do not intend to include brainstorming time in my count.

**5/28 (7pm-9:30pm, 2.5 hours):**

  * **Elements Worked On:** Set up new rails app, created schema and relationships between models, created some views (but will need to make many more), started work on Yelp API communication, as well as login/logout functionality.
  * **Thoughts:** I opted to go with keeping a database of users, rather than authenticating via another website. I'm realizing that I can see "the bigness" that could come of this app, and I'll probably want to expand greatly on what I'll be able to complete in this limited amount of time. Spoke with Jake re: gamification ideas. Expansion idea - Speak with Dane and Cyndy re: gamification, have Jake write narrative content, speak with Erin re: graphics.
  * **Current Amount of Time Elapsed:** 2.5 hours

**5/29 (9:30am-11:15am, 1.75 hours):**
  * **Elements Worked On:** User sign up, login, and logout all working. Used bcrypt/password_digest for authenticating.
  * **Thoughts:** I'm feeling really good of the login/auth process. I did not work on this section of betsy, so I was nervous that it would take me a lot longer than it actually did. Very few hiccups and errors.
  * **Current Amount of Time Elapsed:** 4.25 hours

**5/29 (4:45pm-9:30pm, 4.75 hours):**
  * **Elements Worked On:** App is communicating with the Yelp API, and the info is being returned.
  * **Thoughts:** I'm feeling really good with the Yelp API return response, and how I'm pulling it out. I'm currently struggling with with ActiveRecord telling me that I cannot make a new instance of Nom (restaurant). Error: Undefined method for [] nilclass. I chased that to the point of being unproductive, so I'm calling it. The Better Errors error isn't all that descriptive, and while many people have encountered this out on the wilds of the internet, I have been unable to find a solution as to why **I** am getting it. Boo.
  * **Current Amount of Time Elapsed:** 9 hours
