**5/24-5/26:**
  **Elements Worked On:** Brainstorming.
  **Thoughts:** See Read Me.
  **Current Amount of Time Elapsed:** I do not intend to include brainstorming time in my count.

**5/28(7pm-9:30pm, 2.5 hours):**
  **Elements Worked On:** Set up new rails app, created schema and relationships between models, created some views (but will need to make many more), started work on Yelp API communication, as well as login/logout functionality.
  **Thoughts:** I opted to go with keeping a database of users, rather than authenticating via another website. I'm realizing that I can see "the bigness" that could come of this app, and I'll probably want to expand greatly on what I'll be able to complete in this limited amount of time. Spoke with Jake re: gamification ideas. Expansion idea - Speak with Dane and Cyndy re: gamification, have Jake write narrative content, speak with Erin re: graphics.
  **Current Amount of Time Elapsed:** 2.5 hours
