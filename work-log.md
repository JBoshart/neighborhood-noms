**5/24-5/26:**

  * **Elements Worked On:** Brainstorming.
  * **Thoughts:** See Read Me.
  * **Current Amount of Time Elapsed:** I do not intend to include brainstorming time in my count.

**5/28 (7pm-9:30pm, 2.5 hours):**

  * **Elements Worked On:** Set up new rails app, created schema and relationships between models, created some views (but will need to make many more), started work on Yelp API communication, as well as login/logout functionality.
  * **Thoughts:** I opted to go with keeping a database of users, rather than authenticating via another website. I'm realizing that I can see "the bigness" that could come of this app, and I'll probably want to expand greatly on what I'll be able to complete in this limited amount of time. Spoke with Jake re: gamification ideas. Expansion idea - Speak with Dane and Cyndy re: gamification, have Jake write narrative content, speak with Erin re: graphics.
  * **Current Amount of Time Elapsed:** 2.5 hours

**5/29 (9:30am-11:15am, 1.75 hours):**
  * **Elements Worked On:** User sign up, login, and logout all working. Used bcrypt/password_digest for authenticating.
  * **Thoughts:** I'm feeling really good of the login/auth process. I did not work on this section of betsy, so I was nervous that it would take me a lot longer than it actually did. Very few hiccups and errors.
  * **Current Amount of Time Elapsed:** 4.25 hours

**5/29 (4:45pm-9:30pm, 4.75 hours):**
  * **Elements Worked On:** App is communicating with the Yelp API, and the info is being returned.
  * **Thoughts:** I'm feeling really good with the Yelp API return response, and how I'm pulling it out. I'm currently struggling with with ActiveRecord telling me that I cannot make a new instance of Nom (restaurant). Error: Undefined method for [] nilclass. I chased that to the point of being unproductive, so I'm calling it. The Better Errors error isn't all that descriptive, and while many people have encountered this out on the wilds of the internet, I have been unable to find a solution as to why **I** am getting it. Boo.
  * **Current Amount of Time Elapsed:** 9 hours

**5/30-6/4 Hotel Wifi Down. No ability to commit or look up anything. No real work able to get done.**

**6/5 (9:45am-11:45am, 2 hours):**
  * **Elements Worked On:** Created show page for listing found items. Tried, again, to save restaurants to the database, but unfortunately no dice.  
  * **Thoughts:** I have sunk a number of hours into saving the search results from the API to the database. This is vital functionality, but at this point (4 hours before "work cut off time") I think I need to switch gears so that I can focus on my other goals for this project.
  * **Current Amount of Time Elapsed:** 11 hours

**6/5 (5:30pm - 8:30pm, 3 hours):**
  * **Elements Worked On:** Spent a little more time trying to get maps to save to the database, but really needed to move on. Updated views. But...see below:
  * **Thoughts:** When I started this project I decided to keep work on this project to be between 10 and 15 hours (per the requirements), or, the work that I could do in two days On-The-Job. I *could* pour a great deal more time into it, and produce something that is, well, finished (or closer to it). But I understand that this is an assessment of what I can do in 10-15 hours, and I wanted to be honest about what I can achieve in that amount of time. I am currently at the 14 hour mark. Anything I could start would be more than one hours worth of work, so I have decided to leave it here. I would like to continue work on this project.
  * **Current Amount of Time Elapsed:** 14 hours

**Closing thoughts:**
  Since I have stated "Success should always be measured in understanding, which is what I am looking for deepening with this project" I am trying to hold true to that. This project is not all I wish it could be, but I do think I was successful in some of my goals.

    I have deepened my understanding and am thus proud of:
    * The user sign-up and sign-in and out functionality. I have not done this on previous projects, and I feel like I understand it well now.
    * Interacting with APIs. I had a very hard time with the Tunes & Takeout project, and I feel that if I started that assignment now I would have a much better go of it.

    What I wish I could have done (or done better):
    * The "saving maps to the database" problem plagued me for 1/3 of the time duration on this project. I wish I could have solved the problem, or given up more quickly. This would have been something I would have asked for help with in class. I wish I could have done that.
    * Controller testing. This item was one of the elements that I could have started now (at the 14 hour mark), but would have come nowhere close to finishing (or likely getting any appreciable work done at all). Instead of starting and spinning my wheels I am going to spend the last hour of my 15 to read the rails guide on testing. 
    * Styling.
